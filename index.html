    <p>People should have a global perspective on environmental and social issues and think about the impact of their actions on <br>the entire planet. At the same time, it also encourages<br>people to take concrete steps in their own communities to help address these issues.<br> This can include volunteering for local environmental organizations,<br> reducing energy consumption at home, and supporting sustainable business practices.<br> By thinking and acting locally, individuals can make a difference and contribute to solving global problems.</p>

        <h3>planting</h3>
        <p>  Planting trees helps to absorb carbon dioxide and reduce air pollution.
            It also provides habitat for wildlife and increases biodiversity.
            Planting also helps to prevent soil erosion and improve soil health.
            Trees provide shade and can help to lower urban temperatures.
            Communities can come together to participate in tree planting events to enhance community bonding.</p>

        <h3>recycle</h3>
        <p>  Recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators.
            It conserves natural resources such as timber, water, and minerals.
            Recycling also reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing of new products.
            It creates jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries.
            Participating in recycling programs is a simple and effective way for individuals to help protect the environment.

        <h3>water saving</h3>
        <p>Water harvesting and storage helps to conserve water and reduce dependence on municipal supply.
            It helps to recharge groundwater levels and improve water security.
            Stored water can be used during times of water scarcity and drought.
            It also helps to reduce the amount of runoff and flooding during heavy rains.
            Communities can implement rainwater harvesting systems at household, neighborhood and city-level to improve water management.</p>

        <h3>tree saving</h3>
        <p>  Protecting existing trees helps to preserve ecosystems and wildlife habitat.
            Mature trees provide numerous environmental benefits such as air purification and carbon sequestration.
            Preserving old growth forests helps to maintain genetic diversity and stability of forest ecosystems.
            Trees also have cultural and historical significance, and can be landmarks in communities.
